# Testing
I conducted manual testing throughout the project development, ensuring that each component was thoroughly tested as it was implemented. To inspect code and its effect on the rendered site simultaneously, I utilized Google Chrome DevTools in the browser.

### Google's Lighthouse Performance
Google Chrome Dev Tools Lighthouse function to check the performance, accessibility and search engine optimization with scores documented below.

### Browser Compatibility

I've personally tested the website on Android and Windows laptops, and everything is displaying correctly. Additionally, I've asked friends and family to access it on Macs and other devices, and they have confirmed that it works well for them too.

### Responsiveness
Website is fully responsive, with use of 4 breakpoints:

- 375px - mobile size,
- 768px - tablet size,
- 1440px - desktop size,
- 1950px - desktop large size.

### Code Validation

### HTML

I used [W3 HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) to validate all HTML files by URI, pasting each page into the address bar and checking to ensure no errors were found. After changing one section element to a div and removing the trailing / from an img tag, all sites received no errors.

### Manual Testing user stories

* Home Page Desktop view
<p align="center">

- As a first time user I can see with the information in the homepage what the site is about. Home, login and register links can be seen in the navigation bar. 
- The mobile view, the navigation bar is changed to 3 small bars for better user experience.

- When filling the form, the above images show the tooltip working as it should, if a input field is not filled in, the field is let known to the user. 
- If username or email have been used, the user is alerted with a flask messge of "Username or email already exists". 

-When form is filled correctly, the user is registered and redirected to the login page as seen below with a Flask message "Registration successful".
